### How to use webpack ??

Install node: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-16-04

If there is a problem with 'node' invoke `ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node`

Install webpack: `npm install webpack -g`

Cmd: `npm install` than `npm start` (with watch) or `npm build`
